# Neural-Network-Fish
These fish use deep neural networks to process information about their environment and decied how they should act within it. Fish that find food live and those who don't die. When the number of living fish falls below a threshold, the successful fish become parents of the next generation. The genetic algorithm is used to determine the genetics (weights) for the successive generational groups of fish.
